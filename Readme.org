* Poetry.el

  [[https://poetry.eustace.io/][Poetry]] in Emacs.

  From Poetry documentation:
  "Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you."

  ~Poetry.el~ is a wrapper around Poetry, offering a simple an intuitive interface in Emacs.

** Installation

*** From Melpa

Poetry.el is available on Melpa, the most straightforward way of installing it is to use ~use-package~:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package poetry
 :ensure t)
#+END_SRC

*** Manually

   1. Dependencies

      Poetry.el needs ~transient~ and ~pyvenv~ to be installed.
      These packages are both available on MELPA.

   2. Clone the ~poetry.el~ repository:

      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      $ git clone https://github.com/galaunay/poetry.el /path/to/poetry.el
      #+END_SRC

   3. Add the following lines to ~.emacs.el~ (or equivalent):

      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
      (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/poetry.el")
      (require 'poetry)
      #+END_SRC


** Usage

   Poetry.el uses [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient]] to provide a magit-like interface.
   The entry point is simply:
   #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry
   #+END_SRC
   The interface should then be pretty much self-explanatory for poetry users:

   #+attr_html: :width 400px

   For users not familiar with how ~Poetry~ works, the [[https://poetry.eustace.io/docs/][documentation]] is a great place to start.


*** Tracking Poetry virtualenv
    ~Poetry.el~ also provides a global minor mode that automatically activate the correct virtualenv when visiting Poetry project files.
    You can activate this feature with:
    #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
M-x poetry-tracking-mode
    #+END_SRC
